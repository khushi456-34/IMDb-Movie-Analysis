# IMDb-Movie-Analysis.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow, starting with a raw dataset and ending with a professional, interactive dashboard. The goal was to explore a comprehensive movie dataset to uncover key insights about the film industry, such as popular genres, top-rated directors, and financial performance over time.

The Tools I Used
SQL: To structure the data into a relational database and perform powerful, aggregate queries to answer specific business questions.

Power BI: To connect to the SQL database, import the results of my queries, and design a dynamic and visually appealing dashboard.

My SQL queries were designed to answer the following questions:

Q.1 What are the most popular movie genres in the dataset? By grouping and counting movies by genre, I identified which categories have the highest number of film?

Q.2 Who are the top-rated directors? I analyzed director performance by calculating the average rating of their movies, but with a critical condition: only directors with at least 10 films were included to ensure the results were statistically significanT?

Q.3 How have movie budgets and gross incomes changed over time? I used SQL to sum up financial data across different decades to spot major trends in the film industry's finances?


The Final Outcome: An Interactive Dashboard

The final part of the project was creating a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard is more than just a set of charts; it's a tool for exploration. It visually presents the results of my analysis and includes interactive filters (like year or genre slicers) that allow users to dive deeper into the data and discover their own insights.

This project showcases my ability to not only use the essential tools of data analysis but also to think critically about data, clean it effectively, and present the findings in a clear, compelling, and interactive way.
